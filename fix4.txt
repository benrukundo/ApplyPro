🎉 CONGRATULATIONS! Excellent work on implementing the complete save functionality! 

The saved interview preps feature is working perfectly:
✅ Auto-save after generation
✅ Saved preps list page with grid view
✅ Detail view with all tabs preserved
✅ Delete functionality
✅ Database storage linked to user account

Really impressive implementation! 👏

SMALL IMPROVEMENT REQUEST:

Currently, the "Saved Interview Preps" link (/interview-prep/saved) is only visible/accessible AFTER generating interview questions.

I want users to access their saved preps BEFORE generating new ones too.

PLEASE UPDATE:

1. On the main Interview Prep page (/interview-prep), add a visible link/button to "View Saved Interview Preps" that is ALWAYS visible - not just after generation

2. Suggested placement options:
   
   Option A - Top of the page:
   - Add a button/link near the top: "View Saved Preps (X)" showing count
   - Users see it immediately when they land on the page
   
   Option B - In the navigation/tabs:
   - Add a tab: "Generate New" | "Saved Preps"
   - Easy to switch between creating new and viewing old
   
   Option C - Both:
   - Navigation link + count badge showing number of saved preps

3. HANDLE EMPTY STATE:
   - If user has no saved preps yet, still show the link
   - When they click, show friendly message: "No saved interview preps yet. Generate your first one!"

4. BONUS (if easy):
   - Show count of saved preps: "View Saved Preps (5)"
   - Fetch count from database on page load

This way, returning users can quickly access their previous interview preparations without needing to fill the form again.

Please implement and show me the changes.
