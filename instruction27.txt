TASK: Remove "Back to Home" and similar back links from all pages

The navbar already provides navigation, so these links are redundant and add visual clutter.

SEARCH AND REMOVE in the following files:

1. app/pricing/page.tsx
   REMOVE this entire block:
   <Link
     href="/"
     className="inline-flex items-center gap-2 text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 font-medium mb-8 transition-colors"
   >
     <ArrowLeft className="w-4 h-4" />
     Back to Home
   </Link>

2. app/privacy/page.tsx
   REMOVE this entire block (appears twice - top and bottom):
   <div className="mb-8">
     <Link
       href="/"
       className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 font-medium inline-flex items-center gap-2 transition-colors"
     >
       ← Back to Home
     </Link>
   </div>
   
   Also REMOVE the bottom "Return to Home" button:
   <div className="mt-12 pt-8 border-t">
     <Link
       href="/"
       className="inline-flex items-center justify-center px-6 py-3 bg-blue-600 text-white font-semibold rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-700 transition-colors"
     >
       Return to Home
     </Link>
   </div>

3. app/terms/page.tsx
   REMOVE same blocks as privacy page (top back link and bottom return button)

4. app/generate/page.tsx
   CHECK if there's a "Back to Home" or "Back to Dashboard" link and REMOVE if redundant
   (The current redesign may already have this handled)

5. app/ats-checker/page.tsx
   SEARCH for and REMOVE any "Back to Home" links

6. app/build-resume/page.tsx
   SEARCH for and REMOVE any "Back to Home" links

7. app/interview-prep/page.tsx
   SEARCH for and REMOVE any "Back to Home" links

8. app/linkedin-optimizer/page.tsx
   SEARCH for and REMOVE any "Back to Home" links

9. app/templates/page.tsx
   SEARCH for and REMOVE any "Back to Home" links

10. app/tracker/page.tsx
    SEARCH for and REMOVE any "Back to Home" links

ALSO: Remove unused ArrowLeft import from files where it's no longer needed after removing the back links.

GENERAL RULE:
- Remove any link that says "Back to Home", "Back to Dashboard", "Return to Home", etc.
- The navbar logo clicks to home (for non-logged-in users) or dashboard (for logged-in users)
- The navbar provides all necessary navigation

EXCEPTION:
- Keep breadcrumbs if they exist (e.g., "Dashboard > Settings > Account")
- Keep contextual "Back" buttons in multi-step wizards (e.g., Resume Builder steps)
