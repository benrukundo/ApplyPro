The "Generate Interview Preparation" button is disabled even after completing all the required steps in the interview preparation form.

CURRENT FLOW:
1. User uploads resume (PDF file)
2. User pastes job description
3. User provides job title
4. User provides company name (optional)
5. User selects interview type
6. Button "Generate Interview Preparation" should be enabled - BUT IT'S DISABLED

STEPS TO FIX:

1. FIND the interview preparation form component (check files like InterviewPrep.tsx, InterviewForm.tsx, or similar in the components folder)

2. IDENTIFY all the form state variables:
   - resume (file upload)
   - jobDescription (text)
   - jobTitle (text)
   - company (text - optional)
   - interviewType (select/dropdown)

3. LOCATE the button's disabled logic and CHECK what conditions are being validated

4. DEBUG by adding this console.log to see current state:
   
   useEffect(() => {
     console.log('Form State:', { 
       resume, 
       jobDescription, 
       jobTitle, 
       company, 
       interviewType 
     });
   }, [resume, jobDescription, jobTitle, company, interviewType]);

5. FIX the validation logic. The button should be ENABLED when:
   - resume file is uploaded (not null/undefined)
   - jobDescription is not empty
   - jobTitle is not empty
   - interviewType is selected
   - (company is OPTIONAL - should not block the button)

6. COMMON ISSUES TO CHECK:
   - Is the resume file state updating correctly after upload?
   - Is company being required in validation when it should be optional?
   - Is interviewType defaulting to a valid value or empty?
   - Are there any async issues with file upload state?

7. EXPECTED FIX should look something like:

   const isFormValid = 
     resume !== null && 
     jobDescription.trim().length > 0 && 
     jobTitle.trim().length > 0 && 
     interviewType !== '';

   <button
     disabled={!isFormValid}
     onClick={handleGenerate}
   >
     Generate Interview Preparation
   </button>

8. TEST the fix by:
   - Uploading a resume
   - Pasting a job description
   - Entering a job title
   - Selecting an interview type
   - Verify button becomes enabled
