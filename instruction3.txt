The interview preparation feature is now working. I want to add a SAVE functionality so users can save their generated interview questions and answers to review later, instead of regenerating every time.

FEATURE REQUIREMENTS:

1. SAVE FUNCTIONALITY:
   - Add a "Save Interview Prep" button after questions/answers are generated
   - Save the following data:
     * Generated questions and answers
     * Job title
     * Company name
     * Interview type
     * Date/time saved
     * Resume file name (for reference)

2. STORAGE OPTIONS (choose the best approach for our app):
   
   Option A - Local Storage:
   - Save to browser localStorage
   - Simple, no backend changes needed
   - Data persists on same device/browser
   
   Option B - Database:
   - Save to our existing database (if we have user authentication)
   - Link saved preps to user account
   - Accessible from any device

3. SAVED INTERVIEW PREPS PAGE:
   - Create a new page/section "My Saved Interview Preps" or "History"
   - Display list of all saved interview preparations
   - Show: Job Title, Company, Interview Type, Date Saved
   - Allow user to click and VIEW full questions/answers
   - Add DELETE option to remove saved preps

4. UI COMPONENTS NEEDED:
   - "Save Interview Prep" button (after generation)
   - "Saved" or "History" link in navigation
   - List view of saved preps
   - Detail view to review questions/answers
   - Delete confirmation modal

5. DATA STRUCTURE example:
   
   {
     id: unique_id,
     jobTitle: "Software Engineer",
     company: "Irembo",
     interviewType: "Technical",
     resumeName: "my_resume.pdf",
     questions: [
       {
         question: "Tell me about yourself...",
         answer: "..."
       },
       // more questions
     ],
     createdAt: timestamp
   }

6. USER FLOW:
   - User generates interview prep → clicks "Save" → success message
   - User navigates to "Saved Preps" → sees list → clicks one → views full Q&A
   - User can delete old preps they no longer need

Please implement this feature .
This will give users a much better experience by letting them save and review their interview preparations anytime!
