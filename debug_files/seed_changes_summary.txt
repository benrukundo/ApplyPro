Seed changes summary
=====================

Date: 2025-12-25

Summary of work performed (by assistant):

- Added/verified TypeScript Prisma seed script:
  - `prisma/seed-examples.ts` is present and contains the full seed logic for job categories, resume examples, and skill suggestions.

- Ran the seed against the provided DATABASE_URL (kept private). Results:
  - jobCategories: 25
  - resumeExamples: 83
  - skillSuggestions: 35

- Added a small verification script to check seeded rows:
  - `scripts/check_seed.js` (committed and pushed)

- Reduced duplication by adding a shared seed data module:
  - `prisma/seed-data.ts` (shared `jobCategories`, `skillSuggestions`, and a representative `resumeExamples` subset)
  - Updated `prisma/seed-examples.ts` to import shared `jobCategories` and `skillSuggestions`.

- Updated admin seeding endpoint:
  - `app/api/admin/seed/route.ts` now imports `jobCategories` from `prisma/seed-data.ts` (avoids duplicating job categories).

- Updated Prisma seed configuration:
  - `package.json` `prisma.seed` now runs the TypeScript seed via `ts-node --compiler-options {"module":"CommonJS"} prisma/seed-examples.ts` so `npx prisma db seed` works directly.

- Commits and pushes:
  - All changes (verification script, shared seed-data, seed script updates, admin route updates, package.json change) have been committed and pushed to branch `main`.

Notes & recommendations:
- If you want the admin endpoint to seed the full `resumeExamples`, move the full `resumeExamples` array into `prisma/seed-data.ts` (currently `seed-examples.ts` keeps the full list).
- Keep secret DB credentials out of commits and environment files; use environment variables in CI or a secrets manager.
